NAME
    Test::Filename - Portable filename comparison

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::Filename tests => 2;
  
      filename_is  ( "some\path", "some/path", "should pass" );
      filename_isnt( "some\path", "some/path", "should fail" );

DESCRIPTION
    Many cross-platform test failures -- particularly on Win32 -- are due to
    hard-coded file paths being used in comparison tests.

      my $file = get_file();     # returns "foo\bar.t";
      is( $file, "foo/bar.t" );  # fails on Win32

    This simple module provides some handy functions to convert all those
    path separators automatically so filename tests will just DWIM.

    The alternative is to write your own utility subroutine and use it
    everywhere or just keep on littering your test code with calls to
    File::Spec -- yuck!

      is( $file, File::Spec->canonpath("some/path"), "should pass" );

    Since this module is so simple, you might not think it worth including
    as a dependency. After all, it's not *that* hard to always remember to
    use File::Spec, Path::Tiny or some other file utility, right? But odds
    are that, at some point, you'll be so busy writing tests that you'll
    forget and hard-code a path in your haste to show what a clever
    programmer you are.

    So just use this module and stop worrying about it. You'll be happier
    and so will anyone trying to install your modules on Win32.

USAGE
    Just like Test::More, you have the option of providing a test plan as
    arguments when you use this module. The following functions are imported
    by default.

  filename_is
=head2 filename_isnt
        filename_is  ( $got, $expected, $label );
        filename_isnt( $got, $expected, $label );

    These functions work just like "is()" and "isnt()" from Test::More, but
    the first two argument will be cleaned up and normalized to Unix-style
    paths using Path::Tiny. This means that ".\foo.txt" will get normalized
    to "foo.txt" and so on.
